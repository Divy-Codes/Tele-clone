## Note for the reviewer
Although the project afforded a 48-hour timeframe, regrettably, my window was considerably narrower. The communication reached me at 8:14 pm on Saturday, July 13th, and I regrettably only became aware of it the following Sunday. **Given my ongoing commitment to an internship**, Sunday was my sole available day to devote to this endeavor. I kindly request you to take this into consideration while evaluating the project.
