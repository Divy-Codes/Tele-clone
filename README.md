## Introduction
- Checkout the deployed app here :- https://divy-codes.github.io/tele-clone/
- This is a demo project made as part of an assigment for Beyond Chats.
- I have used **Redux Toolkit** for state management and have implemented the dark and night mode along with an animation very similar to that of telegram.
- I could not implement responsiveness or mobile mode because of the paucity of time.
- It was all done on a very short notice. Hence I could not implement a lot of things I could have done otherwise. (See Note for Reviewer in the end for more)

## Note for the reviewer
Although the project afforded a 48-hour timeframe, regrettably, my window was considerably narrower. The communication reached me at 8:14 pm on Saturday, July 13th, and I regrettably only became aware of it the following Sunday. **Given my ongoing commitment to an internship**, Sunday was my sole available day to devote to this endeavor. I kindly request you to take this into consideration while evaluating the project.
